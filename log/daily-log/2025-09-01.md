# Daily Development Log
Date: Monday, September 01, 2025
Project: Echo iOS
Developer: Nancy (李楠)

## 📝 Summary
Today's focus was on enhancing the development workflow with specialized Claude AI agents and improving project documentation. Introduced Dylon (supreme code auditor) and Wayne (iOS product design architect) as specialized AI assistants to complement Nancy's Swift engineering expertise. Updated project configuration to track Claude settings in the repository and created comprehensive development commands.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- Created and configured two specialized AI agents:
  - **Dylon**: Supreme code auditor specializing in iOS/Swift review without write permissions
  - **Wayne**: iOS product design architect with behavioral psychology and statistics expertise
- Established agent template for creating future specialized agents
- Updated .gitignore to track Claude configuration files in private repository
- Created changelog command for automated changelog generation
- Created dailylog command for comprehensive daily development logs
- Updated CLAUDE.md with data storage architecture documentation
- Configured WebSearch as auto-approved tool in settings

## 🔧 Code Changes
### Modified Components
- **Claude Configuration**: New agents and commands structure
- **Documentation**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with storage architecture details
- **Development Tools**: Added automated logging commands

### Files Changed (9 total)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added Nancy's Swift excellence documentation
- `.claude/agent-template.md` - Created template for new agents
- `.claude/agents/dylon.md` - Configured Dylon code auditor
- `.claude/agents/wayne.md` - Configured Wayne product designer
- `.claude/commands/changelog.md` - Changelog generator command
- `.claude/commands/dailylog.md` - Daily log generator command
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added WebSearch to auto-approved tools
- `.gitignore` - Updated to track Claude files in private repo
- `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced with data storage documentation

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **Agent Specialization**: Separated code review (Dylon) from implementation (Nancy) and design (Wayne)
- **Tool Access Control**: Dylon and Wayne have no Edit/Write permissions, maintaining clear boundaries
- **Configuration Tracking**: Decided to track Claude configuration since this is a private repository
- **Automated Documentation**: Implemented changelog and daily log generators for better project tracking
- **Model Selection**: All agents use Opus model for highest quality outputs

## 🐛 Issues Encountered
- None today - focused on development workflow improvements

## 📊 Metrics
- **Commits**: 1 major feature commit
- **Lines added**: 879
- **Lines removed**: 69
- **Net change**: +810 lines
- **Files modified**: 9
- **New features**: 2 AI agents, 2 development commands

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Focus
- Test the new AI agents in actual code review scenarios
- Use Dylon to audit recent audio service changes
- Have Wayne review the user experience flow
- Consider implementing export/import functionality
- Review memory usage optimizations with Dylon

## 📝 Notes
- The agent trinity (Nancy, Dylon, Wayne) provides comprehensive coverage: implementation, review, and design
- Each agent maintains the English-only response protocol regardless of input language
- Agent templates make it easy to create specialized assistants for specific domains
- Changelog and daily log commands will help maintain better project documentation
- Consider adding more specialized agents for testing or documentation in the future
