Discuss, no rush to coding:



 What if users tap another card while one is still playing?



‚è∫ Great question! Let's analyze the current behavior and potential issues when users tap another card while one is

 playing.



 **Current Behavior Analysis**



 Looking at the code, here's what currently happens:



 In ScriptCard.swift:



 \- When a card is tapped, it calls audioService.play(script:)

 \- The play button shows different states based on isPlaying and currentPlayingScriptId

 \- Each card checks if it's the currently playing one



 In AudioCoordinator/PlaybackService:



 \- When play() is called, it first **stops any recording** if in progress

 \- But it does **NOT** automatically stop current playback

 \- The new playback just starts, potentially creating overlapping audio



 **The Problem**



 **Current Issue**: If Card A is playing and user taps Card B:

1. Card B starts playing immediately
2. Card A might still be playing (audio overlap)
3. The UI state becomes inconsistent - both cards might show as "playing"
4. The currentPlayingScriptId gets updated to Card B, but Card A's audio continues



 **Potential Solutions**



 Option 1: **Auto-Stop Previous (Most Common UX)**



 \- When starting new playback, automatically stop the current one

 \- Similar to music players - new song stops the current one

 \- **Pros**: Clean, expected behavior

 \- **Cons**: User loses their position in the previous audio



 Option 2: **Prevent New Playback (Conservative)**



 \- Show an alert: "Another script is playing. Stop it first?"

 \- **Pros**: Explicit user control

 \- **Cons**: Extra tap, might feel restrictive



 Option 3: **Queue System (Advanced)**



 \- Add new script to a playback queue

 \- **Pros**: Power user feature

 \- **Cons**: Complex, might not fit the app's simple nature



 Option 4: **Smart Context Switch (Hybrid)**



 \- If same script: pause/resume

 \- If different script: stop previous, start new

 \- If in interval: skip to next repetition

 \- **Pros**: Intelligent behavior

 \- **Cons**: More complex logic



 **My Recommendation**



 **Option 1 (Auto-Stop)** seems most appropriate for Echo because:



1. **Matches user expectations** - Similar to all media players
2. **Prevents confusion** - Clear which script is active
3. **Simple implementation** - Just add stop check in play method
4. **Fits use case** - Self-talk scripts are typically short, focused sessions



 The fix would be simple - in PlaybackService.startPlayback(), add:

 // Stop any current playback first

 if isPlaying {

   stopPlayback()

 }



 **Additional Considerations**



1. **Visual Feedback**: The currently playing card already has visual distinction, which is good
2. **Interruption Handling**: The app already handles system interruptions (calls, etc.), so this would be consistent
3. **Repetition Context**: If a script is on repetition 3 of 5, starting a new script would lose that progress -

 acceptable tradeoff

4. **Private Mode**: Starting new playback should respect the new script's privacy settings



 What do you think? Should we go with the auto-stop approach, or would you prefer a different behavior?
